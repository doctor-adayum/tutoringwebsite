##Holiday Programs
We are now offering holiday programs! They are at a special rate: $30 an hour. They are completely personalised based on what each individual student needs, and grounded in psychological research to achieve best results. Catch up or get a great head start before the next term.

###English Program
These programs will be personalised to the student, and will be beneficial for high school English students, especially those going into academic English or looking to improve their grades.

In the four-session holiday program* students will learn:

1. Task sheet comprehension- this is important, as even if you write an amazing story, if you don't meet the conditions of the task, you won't get full marks. Students often miss the mark a bit and lose marks unneccesarily because they miss details on the task sheet.
2. Essay planning- Most pieces of written work- from an analytical exposition to a film review to a speech on a current issue- follow a similar structure. Once you understand this structure, and how to plan a piece of written work, the writing part is much easier, and you can spend more time on finer details to get better marks. 
3. Writing/performing a speech- Lots of people have trouble with public speaking and don't know how to turn a good piece of written work into a good performance.
4. Extracting meaning- We will practice understanding and analysing pieces of text, and pulling out the connotations in the texts. This is a big part of senior English and many other written assignments from other subjects.

We can personalise the program to focus on the students' particular needs, and if a student only wants to practice specific skills, we don't have to have as many sessions.

*We recommend 4 sessions, but this is optional. If there is one particular topic the student is struggling with, we can design the program based on individual needs.

 

###Maths Programs
Our tutors will design an individualised maths program based on student needs. This can be used to enhance maths knowledge to have a heads up going into the next term, or to consolidate topics that may not have been completely grasped. Maths, especially, builds upon previous knowledge continuously, and if there have been gaps it can make life extremely difficult when trying to grasp new topics.
