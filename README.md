##Client notes:
- A new template set up, probably word press, happy to pay for whatever one is best. I'm currently using squarespace and it's good but less easy to customise I think
- Ecommerce- I need to be able to allow people to pay invoices off via the website/purchase products: only 1/2
- A blog/News Page that works, abd maybe that posts to Facebook as well. 
- Not sure if this can be done, if not will continue using Google drive. But a place that tutors can log into to get resources. 
- About page, what people tutor, etc etc (basically same pages I have currently but better haa)
- Can use squarespace and WordPress so I want it to be customisable not hard coded or anything.
